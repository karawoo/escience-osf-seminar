This repository contains slides for my talk "Using the Open Science Framework to
manage and share your research" at the UW eScience Institute's Reproducibility
and Open Science seminar, April 12 2016.

Talk description: The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) is a free, open
source, web-based tool for managing and sharing scientific research projects.
Kara Woo will discuss how researchers are using the OSF to track and share their
work, and give an overview and demonstration of the OSF's capabilities.
